# Quantum Audio Encoding

University Quantum Computing and Entanglement ESA Project titled, Quantum Audio Encoding

This project takes another perspective on the digital encoding of MP3 audio files and uses the quantum concept
of **superdense coding** in an aim to decrease the space needed for an mp3 file.

In simple terms, one quantum bit will store two classical bits.
